# Simulating Evolution

During the project I discovered that Robert Axelrod's famous diagrams of territories of 'meanies' invading colonies of tit for tat-playing good guys wasn't quite what it seemed[^1]. The pretty diagrams weren't colonised by players playing by the stated rules.

On further investigation, it seems that discovery was also made a year earlier by students at the University of Nottingham[^2].
